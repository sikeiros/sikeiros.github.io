    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In August I asked ChatGPT for a life advice. One of the life advices was to create a blog for myself but open if people want to see. What could go wrong, what can be simpler, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after two months of me being pseudo-developer and screaming and uppercasing at ChatGPT,behold. This is a blog that I made on the basis of 11ty, without no particular need or reason. But it is out there now. I&#39;ll try to post pictures and stories that happened during the month, so I could trick myself into thinking that I actually do something valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that people could leave this blog/archive faster, I put my experimental sans(not an official name) in the works. In parallel, I work on it and persuade myself that it also makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hey, funky!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think I made it all work -ish, I&#39;m going to write more about how much fun I had with Rezak Armenian (that&#39;s sarcasm, I don&#39;t understand how I&#39;ll publish it) and how simple it was to create a website and a blog on GitHub Pages (that&#39;s sarcasm, but hey, I only spent around a month of my time on this and 20 bucks on ChatGPT, I guess I don&#39;t need people anymore!)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Originally I was supposed to start in August, but oh well. Here&#39;s my highlights of September as I remember them. Working on my website with ChatGPT was fun, Rezak Armenian Extrabold is a disaster, Rezak Armenian Black is a fun disaster, script for Rezak Black Incised always gives me weird good pics.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;WHY and also, what am I supposed to do with this&lt;/figcaption&gt;

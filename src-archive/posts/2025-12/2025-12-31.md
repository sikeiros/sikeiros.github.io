title: Getting ready for another year
date: 2025-12-31

Finishing this year in a somewhat uplifting/ready to fight mood. I've bought carpets, saw caves and catacombs, saw finished UvA building, started a fantastic research, generally survived and got a permanent residency permit.

Also, this year I made my website and blog, started a diary of despair, diary of hatred and diary of goals – and it made me feel better. Next year I give myself a task to publish more fonts, draw more stupid and unnecessary stuff and finish things I've started in my mind. And – generally to survive. 

And this is the final round of unnecessary stuff for 2025.

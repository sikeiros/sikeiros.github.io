title: RSS and stuff

I really don't know why, but I feel that all of this is right. Instagram brings clients (as some people say) and anxiety. I don't expect this blog to bring me any of that. This should be a safe space for posting momentary work stuff, but sometimes smartass texts as well. I really like the RSS idea that was suggested to me by this amazing person I met in a train with a faulty AC in 30 degrees (so...maybe that was a dream?), and I would like to thank my friend [Alexandr](@yacodes@mastodon.social) for helping me with setting it up.

I checked, not a lot of people use RSS, so it's a perfect ratio of sh*tposting and visibility. If you follow me this way, you must have really ~~weird~~ serious reasons to do so. And thank you for that, truly. 

And few pictures to mark this week's work, otherwise I feel like I haven't done anything.

Originally I was supposed to start in August, but oh well. Here's my highlights of September as I remember them. Working on my website with ChatGPT was fun, Rezak Armenian Extrabold is a disaster, Rezak Armenian Black is a fun disaster, script for Rezak Black Incised always gives me weird good pics.

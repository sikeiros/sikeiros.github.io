          <p>In August I asked ChatGPT for a life advice. One of the life advices was to create a blog for myself but open if people want to see. What could go wrong, what can be simpler, right?</p>
<p>So, after two months of me being pseudo-developer and screaming and uppercasing at ChatGPT,behold. This is a blog that I made on the basis of 11ty, without no particular need or reason. But it is out there now. I'll try to post pictures and stories that happened during the month, so I could trick myself into thinking that I actually do something valuable.</p>
<p>So that people could leave this blog/archive faster, I put my experimental sans(not an official name) in the works. In parallel, I work on it and persuade myself that it also makes sense.</p>

<p>Now that I think I made it all work -ish, I'm going to write more about how much fun I had with Rezak Armenian (that's sarcasm, I don't understand how I'll publish it) and how simple it was to create a website and a blog on GitHub Pages (that's sarcasm, but hey, I only spent around a month of my time on this and 20 bucks on ChatGPT, I guess I don't need people anymore!)</p>
